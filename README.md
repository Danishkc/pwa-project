# My PWA Project

This is a project that combines ExpressJS, React, and Django to create a simple Progressive Web App (PWA) with a backend that handles text submission, connection logging, and ngrams analysis.

## Project Structure

- `express-backend/`: ExpressJS backend that receives text input and logs connections.
- `react-pwa/`: React PWA frontend that accepts text input and interacts with the backend.
- `django-backend/`: Django backend with an API for ngrams analysis using NLTK.
- `README.md`: You're reading it!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up and run the Express backend, React frontend, and Django backend separately.
3. Open your browser and access the React app.
